# Time-Tracking-Application

The "TimeTracking Application" project is developed to manage the working hours of company employees. The application utilizes a SQL database to store and manage information about employees' working hours.

Key Features:
- Employee and work hour management: The application allows adding, updating, and deleting employees from the system, as well as recording and updating their work hours in the database.
- User interface: The application's graphical user interface is developed using Visual Studio. This includes features such as viewing and filtering data about employees' working hours.
- Backend of the application: The Employee and TimeTracking classes are developed using Spring Boot, a Java framework for rapid development of Java-based applications. These classes manage CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for the Employee and TimeTracking entities and interact with the SQL database to retrieve and update data.
